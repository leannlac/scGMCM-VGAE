# scGMCM-VGAE: Deep Copula Clustering for High Dimensional Single-cell RNA-seq Data
## Abstract
Cell clustering in single-cell RNA (scRNA-seq) data is essential for downstream analyses. However, analyzing large scRNA-seq dataset presents statistical and computational challenges due to heterogeneity and technical limitations, resulting in sparse data with a great number of zeros. Although deep clustering algorithms have achieved promising progress in analyzing high dimensional scRNA-seq data, there are very limited research works on developing end-to-end integrated methods which combine advanced statistical and deep learning algorithms to cluster and capture the high-dimension and stochastic dependence structure of such highly correlated and sparse data. We propose scGMCM-VGAE, a novel integrated method that end-to-end integrates statistical Gaussian mixture copula model (GMCM) to a variational graph autoencoder (VGAE). In this end-to-end integration, scGMCM-VGAE simultaneously learns the cell-cell relationships through low-dimensional latent representations generated by a variational graph autoencoder and identifies cell clusters by the statistical GMCM. The parameters of both statistical and deep learning models contribute to formulating the designed loss function which is used to optimize the entire integrated method. We evaluate the proposed method on real scRNA-seq data and demonstrate scGMCM-VGAE outperforms various state-of-the-art clustering methods. We evaluate the stability of the proposed method on large scale simulated data and verify the superiority of scGMCM-VGAE over multistage integration.
